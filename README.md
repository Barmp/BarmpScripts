# BarmpScripts

An import and organization of a number of my old scripts and projects for ease of use. This will start life as a private repository until the scripts are scrubbed of any reference to private or identifying data.

## To do:
* Import code from backups into an Unclean folder
* Scrub and move code out of the unclean folder, organize into categories in the root folder.
* Create navigation listings in README file

## CS50 Problemset Code
* Solutions for the first two C code problemsets I worked on. Basic C code, code usually includes the cs50.h library which is not present here.
